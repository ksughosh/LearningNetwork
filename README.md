# Learning Network
A project showcasing social networking for learning through virtual classrooms. The project is built to demonstrate proof of concept and  benefits of social networking in learning environments.

## Android Application
The application is a prototype that retrieves JSON data from online repository and populates news feeds based on the classroom typical to a social network.

### Design

The screenshots towards the left shows the news feed interface where the users write posts similar to a social network but in a virtual classroom sense. 

The screenshot towards right shows the messages. The unread messages have subtle but still apparent visual feedback. The interface was constructed through iterative design.
